  <div class="main">
    <p>I am an <a href="https://github.com/chadpaulson" title="Chad Paulson's GitHub" target="_blank">open source</a> Software Engineer who enjoys building things that enrich people's lives.</p>
    <p>During late 1999, when Indiana University in Bloomington banned the use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010302063840/http://www.napster.com/" target="_blank">Napster</a> on their network, I formed an organization called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010613021444/http://www.savenapster.com/" target="_blank">Students Against University Censorship</a>. The organization was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/university-to-lift-napster-ban/" target="_blank">successful in lifting the Napster ban</a> and helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QfejGOCxIc&ab_channel=ChadPaulson" target="_blank">start the media blitz</a> around the company.</p>
    <p>I quit school after my Sophomore year in 2000 to join San Francisco digital music startup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021120045433/http://www.listen.com/" target="_blank">Listen.com</a>. While at Listen, I was part of a team that developed the first digital music subscription service, known as Rhapsody today.</p>
    <p>After spending a year at Listen, I decided to move to Los Angeles to work in the traditional music industry, as there was room for growth and evolution. In 2001, I worked at <a href="https://www.capitolrecords.com/" target="_blank">Capitol Records</a>, then quickly moved to <a href="https://www.warnerrecords.com/" target="_blank">Warner Bros. Records</a> as the VP of New Media at Capitol took me along. There I served as the Director of New Media and worked on an innovative AOL Instant Messenger chatbot / MTV 2 campaign utilizing the Eliza Perl module for Glassjaw and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among other projects.</p>
    <p>Shortly after deciding to return and finish my degree at Indiana University in 2003, I founded an <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cubeonline23/" target="_blank">open source software</a> project called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041122040333/http://www.warppipe.com/" target="_blank">Warp Pipe</a>. The project was successful in allowing all LAN-based <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/25/mario-goes-online" target="_blank">Nintendo GameCube titles to be played online</a> and we were able to offer the software for PC, Mac, Linux, and BSD. The project was so successful, Warp Pipe met with Nintendo representatives during E3 2005. I strongly feel that Warp Pipe's philosophy helped shape Nintendo's online strategy for the Wii, the successor to the GameCube.</p>
    <p>In late 2005 I joined Chicago independent label <a href="https://victoryrecords.com/" target="_blank">Victory Records</a> where I served as Director of New Media during November, 2005 - February, 2007.</p>
    <p>Soon after Victory, I served as chief software architect / senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.crowdspring.com/" target="_blank">crowdspring</a>, a privately owned startup based in Chicago, from November 2007 to August 2009.</p>
    <p>In 2010 I served as senior software engineer at <a href="https://threadless.com" target="_blank">Threadless</a>, another artist-driven, crowdsourced double sided marketplace based in Chicago, IL.</p>
    <p>I joined <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a> in 2011 as a senior software engineer in order to help launch crowdsourced and monetized artist contributions, an addition to their already impressive mission of building a global visual language with a gallery of curated SVG icons.</p>
    <p>Friends from Obama for America were launching a startup incubated in the Discovery Channel's offices in downtown Chicago and wanted me to be a part of it in 2013. I joined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140329020859/https://curiosity.com/" target="_blank">Curiosity.com</a> as senior software engineer and wrote a web spider to crawl the web for education and edutainment sources used to populate the first versions of the website, before it was comprised of heavily curated in-house content, among other things.</p>
    <p>After losing my Mom to heart disease, I decided to start working in health care technology. In 2016, I became a senior software engineer at <a href="https://healthvana.com" target="_blank">Healthvana</a>, where we improved patient outcomes with digital results delivery, patient portals, clinician dashboards, scheduling and seamless patient intake. I joined <a href="https://www.base10genetics.com/" target="_blank">BASE10 Genetics</a> in 2021 as senior application architect, where I supported and scaled their Pharmacogenetic (PGx), Nutri-Genetic (NGx) and COVID-19 testing product offerings.</p>
    <p>I am currently consulting and working on a social music application while I look for my next role.
